Generate the autocompletion script for the fish shell.

To load completions in your current shell session:

	score-compose completion fish | source

To load completions for every new session, execute once:

	score-compose completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/score-compose.fish

You will need to start a new shell for this setup to take effect.

Usage:
  score-compose completion fish [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help              help for fish
      --no-descriptions   disable completion descriptions
