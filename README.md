# ![Score](docs/images/logo.svg) Score overview

Score aims to improve developer productivity and experience by reducing the risk of configuration inconsistencies between local and remote environments. It provides developer-centric workload specification (`score.yaml`) which captures a workloads runtime requirements in a platform-agnostic manner.

The `score.yaml` specification file can be executed against a _Score Implementation CLI_, a conversion tool for application developers to generate environment specific configuration. In combination with environment specific parameters, the CLI tool can run your workload in the target environment by generating a platform-specific configuration file such as `docker-compose.yaml` or a Helm `values.yaml`. Learn more [here](https://github.com/score-spec/spec#-what-is-score).

## ![Installation](docs/images/install.svg) Installation

To install `score-compose`, follow the instructions as described in our [installation guide](https://docs.score.dev/docs/get-started/install/).

## ![Get Started](docs/images/overview.svg) Get Started

If you already have a `score.yaml` file defined, you can simply run the following command:

```bash
# Prepare a compose.yaml file
score-compose run -f /tmp/score.yaml -o /tmp/compose.yaml
```

- `run` tells the CLI to translate the Score file to a Docker Compose file.
- `-f` is the path to the Score file.
- `-o` specifies the path to the output file.

If you're just getting started, follow [this guide](https://docs.score.dev/docs/get-started/score-compose-hello-world/) to run your first Hello World program with `score-compose`.
