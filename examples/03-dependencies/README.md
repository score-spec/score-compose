# 03 - Dependencies

Score uses `resources` section to describe workload's dependencies. This mechanism can be used to spin-up multi-service setups with `docker-compose`.

For example, `service-a.yaml` score file describes a service that has two dependencies: `service-b` (another workload), and a PostgreSQL database instance:

```yaml
apiVersion: score.dev/v1b1

metadata:
  name: service-a

containers:
  service-a:
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo service-a: Hello $${FRIEND}! Connecting to $${CONNECTION_STRING}...; sleep 10; done"]
    variables:
      FRIEND: ${resources.env.NAME}
      CONNECTION_STRING: postgresql://${resources.db.user}:${resources.db.password}@${resources.db.host}:${resources.db.port}/${resources.db.name}

resources:
  env:
    type: environment
  db:
    type: postgres
  service-b:
    type: service
```

The second workload is described in `service-b.yaml` file and does not have dependencies:

```yaml
apiVersion: score.dev/v1b1

metadata:
  name: service-b

containers:
  service-b:
    image: busybox
    command: ["/bin/sh"]
    args: ["-c", "while true; do echo service-b: Hello $${FRIEND}!; sleep 5; done"]
    variables:
      FRIEND: ${resources.env.NAME}

resources:
  env:
    type: environment
```

To prepare executable `docker-compose` configuration files, convert both score files with `score-compose` CLI tool:

```console
$ score-compose run -f ./service-b.yaml -o ./service-b.compose.yaml
$ score-compose run -f ./service-a.yaml -o ./service-a.compose.yaml --env-file ./.env
```

One last step is to create a `db` service definition and enforce `service-a` dependencies in our target test environment.
Common place to store non-score defined configuration and resources is a root `compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
services:
  service-a:
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_started
      service-b:
        condition: service_started
  db:
    image: postgres:alpine
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=${DB_USER}
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=${DB_PASSWORD}
    ports:
      - '5432:5432'
    volumes: 
      - db:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db:
    driver: local
```

Ensure the `.env` file has all the proper configuration values in palace:

```console
NAME=World
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=postgres
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
```

Now all files can be combined together to spin-up the whole application with `docker-compose`:

```console
$ docker-compose -f ./compose.yaml -f ./service-a.compose.yaml -f ./service-b.compose.yaml --env-file ./.env up
